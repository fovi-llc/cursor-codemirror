# cursor-codemirror

Hello! This is an old version of [Cursor](https://cursor.so/) based off of the [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) text editing component. If you're looking to build your own code editor from the ground-up, this may serve as a useful guide üôÇ Cursor is now based on a fork of VSCodium.

**Features**
* Standard navigation abilities: file tree, "Command P", ripgrep-based search
* Editing table-stakes: split-panes, tabs
* Deep language server support: intellisense, go-to-definition, code actions, linting, symantic syntax highlighting
* Built-in versions of popular extensions: Copilot, Vim/Emacs keys, (beta) Remote-SSH
* AI Features: auto-generated inline diffs and completions, a ChatGPT-style embedded chat, on-hover documentation suggestions

## Development

To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:getcursor/cursor.git
cd cursor
npm i
```

Then, download some non-versioned dependencies (ripgrep binaries and language server js):

```
./setup.sh # Mac/Linux
./setup.ps1 # Windows
```

The resources.zip contains a binary named "rg" which is ripgrep.
